<h3>Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Bananonz</h3>
I'm a developer from Italy, I started coding back in 2020, I don't use usually GitHub because most of my projects are private and are too hard to maintain on GitHub too. If you wan't to contact me send me a message on twitter or at https://discord.bananonz.dev

## Projects

- Owner (aka Developer) of [Green-Bot](https://gree-bot.app), the 83th bigger bot on discord!

- Rest API: [bananonz.dev](https://api.bananonz.dev) simple with a few endpoints, used usually for personal projects.

- NPM Package: [bananonz-wrapper](https://bananonz.dev/bananonz-wrapper) made to simplify requests with the api, fucking outdated ;p.

- Discord tools: [tools](https://tools.bananonz.dev) website to update discord avatars/banners automatically always for my projects.

- Owner of a bunch of verified Discord Bots, bored of them rip (looking for mantainers).
